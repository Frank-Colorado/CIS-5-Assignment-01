# CIS-5-Assignment-01
Assignment-01

SUMMARY
For this assignment I used Visual Studio 2026 and the Github desktop application. I cloned my repository directly into Visual Studio. I explained most of my code and thought process behind each line using comments directly in the main.cpp file. To summarize, I created a class called Introduction to hold all my method functions because it felt wrong to write all of my code and functionality directly into the main function. I then called the methods for the Introduction Class in the main function to run the code. One thing I forgot to mention in my demonstration video is that I used the "void" keyword before each of my methods so that the method would be aware that I would not be returning any values. This functionality is something I was already aware of from my previous experience coding. I created a seperate method for each of the prompts I was supposed to output for this assignment. I only used CIN for inputing my name into the console and then used COUT to output the value to the console. I felt that using CIN for every single prompt would become super tedious having to type out the answer for all of my prompts.
